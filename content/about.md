I am a curious seeker of opportune moments where novel ideas spark connections to prior knowledge.

> I combine arts, maths, and machines to build wonderful things.

## I am **Michael Pilosov, PhD**  
Machine Learning Architect & Engineer

_What I do is_ reduce uncertainty through applying mathematical theory and (perhaps more importantly), with narrative and metaphor when explaining complicated concepts.
I am a bridge.

> I make technical realms more accessible to those seeking new possibilities.

## Write code for people, not machines.

I believe that art should inspire, and practice that in my design of products---both software and educational.
I enable experts to make better decisions by building them new software tools and sharpening their existing ones.

I studied how to quantify and reduce uncertainty by developing a new statistical technique based on measure theory to solve stochastic inverse problems.
I now help individuals and organizations use machine learning to make data-driven decisions, predict useful information, and automate time-consuming processes.


My long-term goal is to cultivate a small network of enduring consulting relationships on technically challenging applications with potential for monumental impact.
I find great fulfilment in mentoring and teaching of subjects related to computational mathematics, machine learning, and software engineering.
