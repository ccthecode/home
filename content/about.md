## I write code for people, not machines.

I am a bridge.
I approach education and software engineering as art.

I enable experts to make better decisions by building them new tools for innovation and sharpening their existing ones.

-----

As an applied mathematician, I created a new statistical technique to reduce uncertainty---and made it accessible as open-source software.

I now use machine learning to make data-driven decisions, predict useful information, and automate time-consuming processes.


My goal is to cultivate a network of enduring consulting relationships built around challenging problems with potential for monumental impact.
