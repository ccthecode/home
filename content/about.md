I am a curious seeker of opportune moments where novel ideas spark connections to prior knowledge.

> I combine arts, maths, and machines to build wonderful things.

I am **Michael Pilosov, PhD**  
Machine Learning Architect & Engineer

_What I do is_ reduce uncertainty through applying mathematical theory and (perhaps more importantly), with narrative and metaphor when explaining complicated concepts.
I see myself as a bridge; _I make technical realms more accessible to those in seek of new possibilities._

> I write code for people, not machines.

I enable experts to make better decisions by building them new software tools and sharpening their existing ones.
For my degree, I studied how to quantify and reduce uncertainty by developing a statistical technique based on measure theory to solve stochastic inverse problems.
In my ensuing career, I help people make better decisions under uncertainty and to automate time-consuming processes.

My long-term goal is to cultivate a small network of enduring consulting relationships on technically challenging applications with potential for monumental impact.
I find great fulfilment in mentoring and teaching of subjects related to computational mathematics, machine learning, and software engineering.
