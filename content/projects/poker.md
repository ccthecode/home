## Your Hand:
{{< poker >}}


## Rules
Gambling would occur on pre-determined intervals (timer), or whenever someone wants to (if you enjoy a bit of chaos).
Proceeding clockwise, everyone must either call or fold on the bet, with only a second to decide.

> _It's fast-paced fun!_

## Variants
How exactly to enforce the time someone has to stay in the game before being kicked out of the round is unclear, we've successfully relied on the honor policy but your mileage may vary depending on the crowd with which you play.

## History
One of the activities I organized as part of Math Club was an event where we incorporated this game as one of the “stations” at our Poker & Games night.

In a sense this was my first successful attempt at writing something that could be used without any technical background whatsoever.
