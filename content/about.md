**Michael Pilosov, PhD**  
Machine Learning Architect & Engineer

> I bridge the gap between mathematics, computation, and your vision of the future.

I enable experts to make better decisions by building them new software tools and sharpening their existing ones.
For my degree, I studied how to quantify and reduce uncertainty by developing a novel statistical technique based on measure theory to solve stochastic inverse problems.
In my ensuing career, I help people make better decisions under uncertainty and to automate time-consuming processes.

My long-term goal is to cultivate a small network of enduring consulting relationships on technically challenging applications with potential for monumental impact.
I find great fulfilment in mentoring and teaching of subjects related to computational mathematics, machine learning, and software engineering.
> Write code for people, not machines.

In studying to become an applied mathematician, I discovered a love for using computers as my research laboratory.
