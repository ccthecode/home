## I write code for people, not machines.

I am a bridge.
I approach education and software engineering as art.

I enable experts to make better decisions by building them new tools for innovation and sharpening their existing ones.

-----


As an applied mathematician, I developed expertise in stochastic inverse problems by creating a new statistical technique based on measure theory and made it acessible as open-source software.

I now use machine learning to make data-driven decisions, predict useful information, and automate time-consuming processes.


My goal is to cultivate a network of enduring consulting relationships built around challenging problems with potential for monumental impact.
