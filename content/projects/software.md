# Software Contributions
I learned so much from free software and feel the need to contribute back.
When I do things now, I make them available so that people can learn from my trials and tribulations.

I believe in making complicated things easier for people to digest, and software contributions is one way I do it.

## ML Starter-Packs
[ml-starter-packs][org] is a Github organization I created to house relatively polished projects for public consumption.

These are the tools I find myself coming back to over and over, whether for educational or development purposes.

## MTG?

## Closed Source

A bit about what I've done for work.
