I am a curious seeker of opportune moments where novel ideas spark connections to prior knowledge.

> I combine art, math, and machines to build wonderful things.

### I am **Michael Pilosov, PhD**
- Machine Learning Architect
- Scientific Software Engineer
- Third Generation Artist


-----


I am a bridge.

> I make technical realms more accessible to those seeking new possibilities.

I quantify and reduce uncertainty by applying mathematical theory and leveraging the power of storytelling to explain complicated concepts.


## Write code for people, not machines.

I approach education and software engineering as art---with attention to beautiful design, usability, and display of technical mastery.
I enable experts to make better decisions by building them new tools for innovation and sharpening their existing ones.

-----


As an applied mathematician, I developed expertise in stochastic inverse problems by creating a new statistical technique based on measure theory and made it acessible as open-source software.

I now use machine learning to make data-driven decisions, predict useful information, and automate time-consuming processes.


My goal is to cultivate a network of enduring consulting relationships built around challenging problems with potential for monumental impact.
