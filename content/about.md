I am a curious seeker of opportune moments where novel ideas spark connections to prior knowledge.

> I combine arts, maths, and machines to build wonderful things.

I am **Michael Pilosov, PhD**  
Machine Learning Architect & Engineer

_What I do is_ reduce uncertainty through applying mathematical theory and (perhaps more importantly), with narrative and metaphor when explaining complicated concepts.
I see my role as a bridge; _I make technical realms more accessible to those in seek of new possibilities._

> I write code for people, not machines.

I believe that art and design should inspire, and apply these principles in my approach to designing interfaces, software, and educational materials.
I enable experts to make better decisions by building them new software tools and sharpening their existing ones.

For my degree, I studied how to quantify and reduce uncertainty by developing a statistical technique based on measure theory to solve stochastic inverse problems.
For my career, I now help individuals and organizations use machine learning to make data-driven decisions, predict useful information, and automate time-consuming processes.


My long-term goal is to cultivate a small network of enduring consulting relationships on technically challenging applications with potential for monumental impact.
I find great fulfilment in mentoring and teaching of subjects related to computational mathematics, machine learning, and software engineering.
