Michael Pilosov, PhD, Machine Learning Architect & Engineer

> I bridge the gap between mathematics, computation, and your vision of the future.

I enable experts to make better decisions by building them new software tools and sharpening their existing ones.



In studying to become an applied mathematician, I discovered a love for using computers as my research laboratory.
